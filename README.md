# A-Light-text-encrypter
This program takes in text and converts it into gibberish and then you can input the gibberish and it tells you the original message.
Please don't use / or ) symbols because index goes out of the bounds ( encryption alogorithm is not that good and my design is bad I think
Some Other symbols may not get encrypted... :< :<
It's like for basic hostel room to room comm. without anyone knowing what the message means.
